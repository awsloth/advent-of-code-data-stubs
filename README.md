# advent-of-code-data-stubs
Added type hinting to the advent-of-code-data library for python

## To install
Place this folder in lib at the same level as the `aocd` file. Feel free to make a pull request for any type changes you want to add, this was my first time creating a stub, so I most likely have messed up somewhere!
